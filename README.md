## DBRecent Values for Thaumaturgy Mats
Updated automatically every +/- 10m when the Blizzard API is updated.

Note that these DBRecent values, while very close to TSM DBRecent values are not always exactly the same.
They can be up to 10% off TSM values but are still Recent AH values that can be used in Spreadsheets or others places where DBRecent data may be wanted.
TSM Does not currently export DBRecent data on their website or API. Only In-Game via their desktop app.
